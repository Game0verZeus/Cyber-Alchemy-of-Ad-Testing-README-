# The Arcane Experiment of ShoeFly.com

## Overview

Within the shadowy realms of the internet, a digital emporium known as ShoeFly.com has embarked on a mystical quest. Armed with two divergent spells - Ad A and Ad B - they seek to unravel the mysteries of persuasion across the ethereal platforms of Facebook, Twitter, and Google.

## The Quest

The alchemists behind ShoeFly.com have conjured a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma, known to the digital oracles as an "A/B Test". Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves diving into the arcane arts of data analysis to decipher which spellbinding advertisement performs the supreme act of enchantment.

## The Scrolls of Data

- `ad_clicks.csv`: A tome of records, chronicling the journey of every soul who encountered the ads.
- `a_clicks.csv` & `b_clicks.csv`: Segregated scrolls, detailing the path of those who beheld the allure of Ad A and Ad B.

## Analyzing Ad Sources

1. Decode the initial enchantments within `ad_clicks` to understand the genesis of our journey.
2. Summon insights to identify the source of the most potent visions.
3. Unveil the veil between those merely bewitched by sight and those truly captivated into action.
4. Transmute data to reveal the percentage of clicks emanating from each source of power.

## Deciphering the A/B Test

1. Analyze the equilibrium between the two spells. Is the distribution of their magic balanced across the realm?
2. Determine which spell - A or B - holds a greater allure, compelling mortals to click with intention.
3. Examine the fluctuations in the spell's potency through the cycle of the week.
